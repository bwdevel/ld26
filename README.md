ld26 - Ludum Dare 26
====================
---

This is the repo for my Ludum Dare 26 submission.

The only work being done prior to the compo is setting up a basic LUA framework so that team members can get started right away rather than waiting for one person to code the framework.

This is perfectly legal within the confines of Ludum Dare rules.

This game will be build on the LÖVE game engine.
